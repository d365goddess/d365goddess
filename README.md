Hello, I'm Dian Taylor!  I have been working with Dynamics 365 since 2011. I also dabble in Power Virtual Agents, Power Automate and Power Apps whenever I get the chance!

Today I work as a Director at RSM US LLP. In my free time I write content for my [website](https://d365goddess.com) and create videos for my youtube channel and work on new LinkedIn Learning courses. I also have an adorable mini poodle named Tucker.
